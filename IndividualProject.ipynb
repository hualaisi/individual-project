    "This project will plan and analyze the coverage of the ad-hoc communications network over a large rectangular. Each individual tower can monitor a rectangular subsection of a specific width and height. The problem is that none of the individual towers can provide coverage for the entire region of interest. Due to technical issues such as cross-talk, no individual rectangular subsection can have multiple towers providing coverage for it. Therefore, this project will find the average of the towers required to cover the entire region and analyze the average coverage after placed each tower.\n",

    "This program is implemented in Python. This program is initially be created as a 2D array, which could also be considered as a matrix. Besides, this 2D array is initialized as all zeros. If the area is covered, the element of the corresponding position will be set as one. After each new tower is placed, this 2D array will be updated and will be visualized with a random color, which will be stored into a list to avoid duplication. Afterward, this program will call getLargestRectangle() function to find the larget non-overlapped rectangle, which will also be visualized and placed into the total region. This function is used by the algorithm name \"Brute Force\", which is the most simples way to find the largest rectangle. While placing each tower into the region, the iterative loop will count the number of iterations, which is also the number of towers. These pieces of information could be used to calculate the average towers, the coverage, the gaps, and further be used to analyze the problems of the number of communications towers.\n",

From the second figure, as more communications towers are added, the resulting resolved coverage will be increased, and the gap in coverage will be reduced. In this case, since the sequence of the communications towers are determined by users, the number of communications tower is required varies in the choices of users.\n",

Based on the second figure, the number of the required towers varies from the size of the region.
